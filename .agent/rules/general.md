## General Overview
- This app is built to act as a companion for a NBA 2K26 MyNBA team rebuild series.
- Realism and fun engagement are the goals.
- Note that NBA 2K does not have a public api, so we cannot import data directly from what's going on in the specific users' series'.

## Good to Knows
- Design using shadcn with lucide icons.
- App hosted on Vercel.
- Ensure app is secure and can handle multiple (<25) concurrent users.
- App UI/layout must be compatible with mobile-scale dimensions.
- Keep features simple and intuitive.
